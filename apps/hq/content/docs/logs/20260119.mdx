## Manifesto Locale Navigation Fix

**Scope**: `apps/web`

### Changes Made

| File | Change |
| ---- | ------ |
| `src/lib/use-note-stack.ts` | Switched to the next-intl router to generate locale-aware stack URLs and avoid hard reloads on non-English note clicks. |

### Technical Decisions

1. **Locale-aware Router**: Use `@/i18n/navigation`'s `useRouter` so stack URL updates respect locale prefixes and sync cookies, preventing full reloads.

### Verification

- TypeScript: Not run (not requested)
- Build: Not run (not requested)
- Tests: Not run (not requested)

### Next Steps

None.
