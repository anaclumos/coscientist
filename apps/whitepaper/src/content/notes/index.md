# Welcome to Whitepaper

This is a documentation site with Andy Matuschak-style sliding panes. Click any link to open it in a new pane to the right, creating a trail of your exploration.

## Getting Started

Start exploring by clicking one of these topics:

- [Evergreen Notes](./evergreen-notes) - A system for developing ideas over time
- [Spaced Repetition](./spaced-repetition) - Techniques for long-term memory retention
- [Note-taking](./note-taking) - Strategies for capturing knowledge effectively

## How Navigation Works

When you click an internal link:
1. A new pane opens to the right
2. Previous panes remain visible
3. You can scroll horizontally to see your exploration trail
4. Click any pane to bring it into focus

This design helps you maintain context while exploring related ideas.
