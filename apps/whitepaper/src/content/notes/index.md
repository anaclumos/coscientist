# Welcome to Terminus

Terminus is the provisional shelter for compiling the Encyclopedia Galactica—inspired by Asimov's fictional archive of all human knowledge. Coscientist is an open-source service dedicated to this mission. This documentation site uses Andy Matuschak-style sliding panes—click any link to open it in a new pane to the right, creating a trail of your exploration.

## Core Concepts

Start with the foundational ideas:

- [Coscientist](./coscientist) - The intellectual companion system for knowledge production
- [Dark Night of the Soul](./dark-night-of-the-soul) - The philosophical foundation: crisis as reconstruction
- [Encyclopedia Galactica](./encyclopedia-galactica) - The [knowledge ark](./knowledge-ark) concept that inspired this project

## The Problem Space

Understanding what we're defending against:

- [Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown) - Knowledge-collapse when AI takes over without human intervention
- [RAG Limitations](./rag-limitations) - Why standard retrieval-augmented generation cannot produce genuine discovery

## The Solution Architecture

The system's core components:

- [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph) - Storing [argumentative acts](./argumentative-act) rather than document content
- [Dialectical Graph Nodes](./dialectical-graph-nodes) - Claim, scope, assumption, definition, method, data, counterexample, issue
- [Dialectical Graph Edges](./dialectical-graph-edges) - supports, attacks, undercuts, refines, cites, contradicts

## Operating Protocols

How the system works:

- [Galarch](./galarch) - The human sovereign over knowledge
- [Multi-AI Consensus Protocol](./multi-ai-consensus-protocol) - The 1+4 human-AI collaboration system
- [Knowledge Synthesis](./knowledge-synthesis) - Making documents collide rather than summarize
- [Exploration Strategies](./exploration-strategies) - Counterexample-first search, contradiction [minimum-cut](./minimum-cut), [definition drift](./definition-drift) detection

## Related Methods

Background on knowledge management:

- [Spaced Repetition](./spaced-repetition) - Techniques for long-term memory retention

## How Navigation Works

When you click an internal link:
1. A new pane opens to the right
2. Previous panes remain visible
3. You can scroll horizontally to see your exploration trail
4. Click any pane to bring it into focus

This design helps you maintain context while exploring related ideas.
