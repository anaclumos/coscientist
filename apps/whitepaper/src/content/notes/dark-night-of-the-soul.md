# Dark Night of the Soul

"The Dark Night of the Soul" (La noche oscura del alma) is a literary device that refers to a profound inner crisis in which identity, faith, and one's system collapse. It looks like breakdown from the outside, but its essence is the process in which the existing structure of the self is dismantled and reorganized around new standards.

## Origin

The concept began in a 16th-century religious context, but in modern usage it denotes existential collapse and reconstruction.

## Characteristics

- **Night** is typically a condition where rewards (comfort, certainty, self-narrative) disappear
- The rewards that previously supported the self (praise, achievements, role in relationships, religious certainty) no longer work
- Attachments, masks, and self-deception are exposed, and the center of value shifts
- Recovery does not appear as a return to the old state, but as a rebuild under new standards

## Relevance to Knowledge Systems

The dark night is not only personal. Civilizations and knowledge systems can undergo similar collapses. In Asimov's Foundation, the fall of the Galactic Empire represents a civilizational dark night. The fictional [Encyclopedia Galactica](./encyclopedia-galactica) in Asimov's work serves as the conceptual foundation for preserving knowledge through darkness.

[Coscientist](./coscientist) is the real open-source implementation of these principles. In this context, the dark night metaphor applies to the risk of [Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown)—a collapse of knowledge integrity that requires systemic rebuilding.
