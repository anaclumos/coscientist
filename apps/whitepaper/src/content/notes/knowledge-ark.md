# Knowledge Ark

A knowledge ark is a repository designed to preserve and transmit knowledge through periods of civilizational decline. It is a cultural strategy for surviving [dark nights](./dark-night-of-the-soul) by safeguarding sources, methods, and context.

The [Encyclopedia Galactica](./encyclopedia-galactica) is a fictional example of this trope.
