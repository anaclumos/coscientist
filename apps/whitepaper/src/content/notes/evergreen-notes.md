# Evergreen Notes

Evergreen notes are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across projects. This is in contrast to notes that are tied to a specific project or time period.

## Key Principles

1. **Atomic** - Each note should capture exactly one idea
2. **Concept-oriented** - Notes should be about concepts, not sources
3. **Densely linked** - Notes should be connected to related ideas
4. **Written for yourself** - Don't worry about explaining everything

Evergreen notes work well alongside:

- [Note-taking](./note-taking) - The broader practice of capturing knowledge
- [Zettelkasten](./zettelkasten) - A similar note-taking system

## Benefits

When you write evergreen notes, you're not just taking notes—you're building a knowledge base that grows more valuable over time. Each new note adds to and strengthens the connections in your existing knowledge.
