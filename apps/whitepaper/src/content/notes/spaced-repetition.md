# Spaced Repetition

Spaced repetition is an evidence-based learning technique that involves reviewing information at increasing intervals. It leverages the psychological spacing effect to move knowledge from short-term to long-term memory.

## How It Works

1. Learn something new
2. Review it after a short interval (1 day)
3. If you remember, increase the interval (3 days, 1 week, etc.)
4. If you forget, reset to a shorter interval

## The Science

Spaced repetition is grounded in research on [Memory](./memory) and how the brain consolidates information. The technique exploits the "forgetting curve" to review information right before you would forget it.

## Applications

Spaced repetition is particularly effective for:

- Language [Learning](./learning)
- Medical education
- Law studies
- Programming concepts

## Tools

Popular spaced repetition software includes Anki, SuperMemo, and various flashcard apps. These tools automatically calculate optimal review intervals based on your performance.
