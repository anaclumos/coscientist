# Note-taking

Note-taking is the practice of recording information from another source. While it seems simple, effective note-taking requires strategy and intention.

## Common Approaches

### Linear Notes
Traditional note-taking in sequence, following the source material's structure.

### Mind Maps
Visual representations of ideas branching from a central concept.

### [Evergreen Notes](./evergreen-notes)
Notes designed to accumulate value over time through linking and refinement.

### [Zettelkasten](./zettelkasten)
A slip-box method emphasizing atomic notes and connections.

## Best Practices

1. **Capture in your own words** - Don't just copy, transform
2. **Review and refine** - Notes are living documents
3. **Create connections** - Link related ideas
4. **Keep it searchable** - Use consistent formatting and tags

## The Goal

The purpose of note-taking isn't to have notes—it's to think better. Notes should help you understand, remember, and create.
