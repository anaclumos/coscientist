# Minimum Cut

A minimum cut is the smallest set of edges whose removal disconnects a graph. In a [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph), minimum cuts are used to isolate the minimal structure that produces a contradiction.

This supports focus on the [Minimum Contradiction Set](./minimum-contradiction-set).
