description: A knowledge ark concept for preserving knowledge across dark ages

# Encyclopedia Galactica

**The Encyclopedia Galactica is a fictional device from Isaac Asimov's Foundation series.** It is a vast repository designed to preserve humanity's knowledge before civilizational collapse. It represents the [Knowledge Ark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_ark) trope deployed as a means of traversing a dark age.

## The Seldon Plan Context

In Asimov's fiction, the mathematician Hari Seldon, having calculated the future with psychohistory, concludes:

1. The collapse of the Empire is unavoidable
2. After the collapse, a dark age of tens of thousands of years will follow
3. But with a specific exit strategy, that dark age can be reduced to roughly one thousand years

The Encyclopedia Galactica is nominally a project to gather knowledge and produce a record. The provisional shelter for compiling the encyclopedia is the planet Terminus.

## Beyond Information Gathering

The Seldon Plan is broader than simple knowledge preservation. It is a long-term strategy that uses psychohistory to design post-collapse flows of power, economy, and technology, forcibly converging the trajectory of civilizational reconstruction.

The Seldon Plan breaks through the [Dark Night of the Soul](./dark-night-of-the-soul) via a seizure into a new order: turning crisis into opportunity.

## Inspiration for Coscientist

**[Coscientist](./coscientist) is the real, open-source implementation inspired by this fictional concept.** To graduate from a prodigal state, one must be able to compile their own Encyclopedia Galactica. The Encyclopedia becomes the engine of a new order, ending the dark night of the soul.

Coscientist transforms Asimov's fictional vision into a practical tool for personal knowledge preservation and organization.
