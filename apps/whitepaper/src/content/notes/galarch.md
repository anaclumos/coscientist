description: The human sovereign over knowledge in Coscientist

# Galarch

The Galarch is the human operator who maintains sovereignty over knowledge in [Coscientist](./coscientist). The term evokes the role of a guardian-architect of the [Encyclopedia Galactica](./encyclopedia-galactica), Asimov's fictional knowledge repository that inspired Coscientist.

## Role

The Galarch's primary responsibility is preventing [Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown) by maintaining initiative over contemplation while using AI as a tool.

## Key Responsibilities

1. **Maintain cognitive sovereignty** - Never let AI replace verification with ratification
2. **Coordinate multi-AI deliberation** - Serve as the intense coordinator in the [Multi-AI Consensus Protocol](./multi-ai-consensus-protocol)
3. **Exercise veto power** - The final human check against consensus drift
4. **Invest time in the minimum contradiction set** - Focus human attention where it matters most

## The Editor's Role

If AI takes initiative over writing, that is meltdown. But if the Galarch maintains initiative over contemplation and uses AI as a tool for contemplation, the Galarch is freed from sentence labor and becomes a supervisor of structure.

## Cultural Requirement

The success of [Coscientist](./coscientist) depends not on technology but on human attitude. The Galarch must culturally habituate the discipline of verification, much as a driver must maintain safe driving habits even with AI safety systems.
