# Memory

Memory is the faculty of the mind by which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved. Understanding memory is fundamental to effective [Learning](./learning).

## Types of Memory

### Short-term Memory
Holds information temporarily (seconds to minutes). Limited capacity—typically 7 ± 2 items.

### Long-term Memory
Relatively permanent storage. Can hold vast amounts of information indefinitely.

### Working Memory
Active manipulation of information. Used for reasoning and decision-making.

## Memory Formation

1. **Encoding** - Information enters the brain
2. **Consolidation** - Brain strengthens the memory trace
3. **Storage** - Memory is maintained over time
4. **Retrieval** - Memory is accessed when needed

## Improving Memory

[Spaced Repetition](./spaced-repetition) is one of the most effective techniques for improving long-term retention. Other strategies include:

- Active recall
- Elaboration
- Sleep (crucial for consolidation)
- Exercise
- Reducing interference
