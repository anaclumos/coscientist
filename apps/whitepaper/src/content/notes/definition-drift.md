# Definition Drift

Definition drift is the gradual shift in meaning of a term across time, schools, or fields. It creates false agreement and false contradiction when the same word is used for different concepts.

In [Coscientist](./coscientist), definition drift is tracked explicitly to prevent silent meaning loss.
