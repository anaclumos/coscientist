# Multi-AI Consensus Protocol

The Multi-AI Consensus Protocol is a collaboration system in which the [Galarch](./galarch) plus four mainstream AIs work together to prevent [Encyclopedia Meltdown](./encyclopedia-meltdown).

## Structure

Encyclopedia writing is carried out as a team of five:
- The [Galarch](./galarch) (human)
- Four mainstream AIs (as of December 2025: ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Grok)

Each AI operates its own independent memory.

## Operating Principles

1. **Unanimity requirement** - Each statement and revision must be unanimous
2. **Explicit uncertainty** - Uncertainty in writing must be explicitly stated and tracked
3. **Traceable metadata** - At the unit of assertion (sentence, paragraph, or document)
4. **Intentional rebuttal search** - In all actions, rebuttal must be deliberately sought
5. **Question training** - A cultural (not just systematic) requirement

## Rationale

The unanimity principle exploits the fact that each AI model's hallucination biases differ, allowing errors to cancel out. At points of conflict, it forces human reasoning—intentionally embedding cognitive friction into system design.

## Critiques and Limitations

### False Diversity Concern
Models share overlapping training data and may converge on "safe" expressions, producing correlated failure. Agreement may reinforce confidence in shared bias rather than truth.

### Usefulness vs. Accuracy Trade-off
As the cost of agreement rises, writing may retreat into vagueness and hedging clauses.

### Independent Memory vs. Independent Evidence
Diverse memories add perspective but can also make traceability harder. The critical variable is "independent evidence channels," not just "independent memory."

## Verdict

In practice, the protocol received 2 approvals, 1 objection, and 1 hold from a multi-AI review—indicating it needs reinforcement with stronger rebuttal procedures and evidence independence rules.
