# Argumentative Act

An argumentative act is a distinct move in reasoning: asserting a claim, defining a term, giving evidence, rebutting, or undercutting. In a [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph), the system stores these acts rather than just raw text.

See also [Dialectical Graph Nodes](./dialectical-graph-nodes) and [Dialectical Graph Edges](./dialectical-graph-edges).
