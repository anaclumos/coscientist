# Zettelkasten

Zettelkasten (German for "slip box") is a personal knowledge management system popularized by sociologist Niklas Luhmann. He used this method to write over 70 books and 400 articles.

## Core Principles

1. **One idea per note** - Keep notes atomic
2. **Write in full sentences** - Not just keywords
3. **Always link** - Connect new notes to existing ones
4. **Use unique identifiers** - Each note has an ID for referencing

## Relationship to Other Methods

The Zettelkasten method shares principles with [Evergreen Notes](./evergreen-notes) and good [Note-taking](./note-taking) practices. The key difference is its emphasis on a specific linking and numbering system.

## How to Start

1. Choose a tool (digital or physical)
2. Create notes as you read or think
3. Link each new note to at least one existing note
4. Review and strengthen connections regularly

## The Power of Links

The magic of Zettelkasten isn't in individual notes—it's in the connections. Over time, your slip-box becomes a thinking partner that surfaces unexpected relationships between ideas.
