description: How synthesis differs from averaging in dialectical knowledge systems

# Knowledge Synthesis

Standard [RAG](./rag-limitations) is strong at retrieval and weak at synthesis because it has no internal object called **[contention](./contention)**. In a [Dialectical Graph](./dialectical-graph), [contention](./contention) is a first-class citizen.

## Synthesis vs. Averaging

**Synthesis is not averaging.** It is aligning premises and scope by translating them into the same coordinate system.

When A and B are incompatible, the system does not merely list both. It decomposes the cause of incompatibility:
- Definition differences
- Sampling differences
- Method differences
- Scope differences
- Time-driven [nonstationarity](./nonstationarity)

## Resolution as a Branched Map

Resolution is not a single answer; it appears as a branched map. If the same term X yields different conclusions under different definitions, the system first records the branching of definition before treating it as a contradiction in conclusion.

## The Role of Issue Nodes

[Issue nodes](./dialectical-graph-nodes) bundle what conflicts with what and record the conditions under which the issue can be resolved. Inter-document agreement arrives as a byproduct, not as the goal.

## The Goal

The goal is a **map of contradictions** and an explicit statement of resolution conditions. The more this map is secured, the more future research or records can update knowledge by rearrangement rather than rewriting.

## AI for Contemplation

Not an AI that summarizes documents, but an AI that **makes documents collide**. Discovery comes from mismatch. The contemplation AI of [Coscientist](./coscientist) produces:

- Issues (what conflicts)
- Refined conditions (when claims hold)
- Structured rebuttals (why claims fail)
- Coordinate systems for synthesis (how to compare)
