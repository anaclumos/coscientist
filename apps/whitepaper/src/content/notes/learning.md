# Learning

Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, or preferences. Effective learning is both an art and a science.

## Learning Principles

### Active Engagement
Passive reading is insufficient. You must actively work with material to learn it.

### Retrieval Practice
Testing yourself is more effective than re-reading. This strengthens [Memory](./memory) traces.

### Spaced Practice
[Spaced Repetition](./spaced-repetition) beats cramming every time for long-term retention.

### Interleaving
Mixing different topics or skills during practice leads to better transfer.

## Obstacles to Learning

- **Illusions of competence** - Feeling like you know something when you don't
- **Cramming** - Works for tests, fails for retention
- **Passive review** - Re-reading without testing yourself
- **Lack of sleep** - Sleep is when memory consolidation happens

## Learning to Learn

Meta-learning—understanding how you learn best—may be the most valuable skill you can develop. Experiment with different techniques and pay attention to what works for you.
