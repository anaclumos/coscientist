# Spacing Effect

The spacing effect is the well-replicated finding that learning is stronger when study sessions are separated by time instead of massed together. It is the psychological basis for [Spaced Repetition](./spaced-repetition) and explains why distributed practice beats cramming.

## Why It Matters

Spacing forces retrieval after partial forgetting, which strengthens the memory trace and improves long-term retention.
